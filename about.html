        I taught myself how to design and code more than 12 years ago, thanks to a <b>popular online game</b> (<a href="mailto:chuasimin10@gmail.com">ask away</a>, I may share more! :P). Over the years, I have been actively honing my skills through purposefully finding/creating opportunities to practise.
        <br><br>
        Thoroughly interested in the human condition, I have a <b>social sciences degree</b>, and have spent the past five years in the education sector, specifically in <b>communications and marketing</b>. In 2020, due to need to digitise as a result of COVID-19 safe management measures, I took on the role of <b>webmaster</b>, where I was perfectly positioned to design and develop usable interfaces for my organisation by fully understanding and harnessing the potential of our <b>content management system</b>.
        <br><br>
        I am also a <b>composer</b>, with a keen interest in wind band music. I love <b>cats</b> too, and hope to adopt one some day!
