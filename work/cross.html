              One of the best things about being in a dynamic environment like that of <a href="https://www.sota.edu.sg" target="_blank">School of the Arts (SOTA)</a>'s are opportunities to <b>work with people across different specialisations</b>. In this section I feature two interfaces I created for departments that weren't my own, in a way functioning as a 'vendor' creating usable web products for my 'clients'.

              SOTA conducts an annual admission exercise for its student intake for the following year. Called the Talent Academy (TA), this is an audition/interview process. The Admissions team, which runs the TA, were facing several <b>challenges in communicating information</b> to prospective students and parents (the users). The web interface back then looked something like this:
            </div>
            <div class="images">
              <div id="ta-old">
                <img src="../img/work/sotacross/ta-old-categories.png" class="sm">
                <img src="../img/work/sotacross/ta-old-faq.png" class="xs">
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              Feedback from users were that it was <b>difficult to find information</b>. I identified the following <b>pain points</b>:
              <br><br>
              <ol>
                <li>the TA had several admission tracks and sub-tracks;</li>
                <li>there were several art forms under each track and sub-track, each with their own unique criteria;</li>
                <li>FAQs were not segmented;</li>
                <li>materials had to be downloaded from time to time; and</li>
                <li>announcements were to made, ad hoc.</li>
              </ol>
              Recognising that it was paramount that things were organised in a manner that made sense to users, I proposed that we first reworked the page's <b>information architecture</b>. Working closely with the Admissions team, we adopted different <b>user personas</b>, and conducted <b>card sorting</b> to eventually arrive at the following <b>user flow</b>:

              <img src="../img/work/sotacross/ta-userflow.jpg" class="md">
              <div class="caption">Potential students and parents tend to look for 'Year of Admission' first as that is commonly the only piece of information they have initially</div>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              Following which, the Admissions team put together the content in a few word documents, sent them my way, and shortly after, voila, the interface was reborn. Had fun developing our combined vision, at the same time learning more about Javascript!
