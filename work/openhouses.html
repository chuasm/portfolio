              Usually a physical event attracting thousands of attendees, the <a href="https://www.sota.edu.sg" target="_blank">School of the Arts (SOTA)</a> Open House is held annually in April, with the target audience being potential students and their parents. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Singapore's 'circuit breaker' lockdown in March, this event was forced online. With just a month's runway, my team put together a holistic e-version. I am proud to have played a major role in the <b>design and development</b> of this event's interfaces in both 2020 and 2021.

              The SOTA Open House has always been well-attended. Held on a single day, the programme is packed, featuring a myriad of activities such as talks, curriculum exhibitions, campus tours, arts showcases, and workshops. Parents and potential students are able to explore the campus while interacting with teachers and students.

              As such, when Singapore's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%9321_Singapore_circuit_breaker_measures" target="_blank">circuit breaker</a> was announced in March 2020, my team had to quickly decide how to take the Open House online; we had to find viable alternatives to migrate several physical events to the digital sphere in a short span of time.
              <br><br>
              One thing was certain: we needed a dedicated web landing page, with <b>integrated modules</b> (i.e. not just chunks of text). As we did not have time to hire an external vendor, I volunteered to work on this, knowing that I had the relevant skillsets to do so.

              The Requirements
              <div></div>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              We first listed out the <b>must-haves</b>: (a) a curriculum exhibition, (b) something that would give insights into each art form offered at SOTA, and (c) somewhere where FAQs could be addressed. With these, I proposed <b>content types and formats</b> which these could be achieved - image modals for the exhibition, videos for the art forms, and collapsible dropdowns for the FAQs - bearing in mind the constraints we were facing in both time and manpower.
              <br><br>
              We then moved on to the <b>nice-to-haves</b>: (i) alumni and parent testimonials, and (ii) a section detailing how to apply to SOTA (the process isn't exactly straightforward!).

            </div>
            <div class="text">
              On top of that, we needed the page to be consistent with our <b>branding</b>. Aside from the school's corporate image, every SOTA Open House had a key visual which all our collaterals were based on - the webpage, of all things, should be of no exception.

              In the interest of time, and also with my colleagues' trust (super thankful!), I headed straight into development. I already had a 'wireframe' in my mind, which I quickly materialised using HTML and CSS. After which, it was a matter of manipulating the aesthetics: I attempted to utilise as many elements/features of the key visual as possible.

              It was helpful to had already been rather familiar with our CMS at this point in time, as I knew exactly where to upload and/or modify files, stylesheets and scripts. However, some <b>challenges</b> that I faced were rather major:
              <br><br>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>our CMS was rather old, so there were limitations e.g. unable to save version history;</li>
                <li>the need to work with existing styles/sheets from the pre-existing .master file;</li>
                <li>my unfamiliarity with Bootstrap back then, and lack of knowledge on other libraries; and</li>
                <li>jQuery being foreign to me. I was coding using <i>vanilla JS!</i></li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="images">

            <div class="text">
              Despite many moments of triumph, being a perfectionist I was unhappy with the load time of the page (5s on average), and how messy my code looked. Also, despite being responsive, the interface was not exactly mobile <i>friendly</i> (tabs were too small!). I made a resolution to do better for future projects.
              <br><br>
              In spite of this, I received much positive feedback about my design, and most importantly the webpage was produced <b>on time</b> and users were <b>able to find what they were looking for</b>.

              After SOTA e-Open House 2020, I found plenty of other opportunities to create interfaces, one of the major ones being the <a class="createState" id="work-sotaawards" onclick="loadWorkAwards()">SOTA e-Awards</a>. During this time, I picked up key frontend frameworks/libraries such <b>jQuery</b> and <b>Bootstrap</b>, and discovered Font Awesome and the AOS Library.
              <br><br>
              These new skillsets came in <i>very</i> useful when I eventually got round to designing for and developing the SOTA e-Open House web interface again in 2021.

              With more time to plan for and execute this event, the 2021 edition saw more features being implemented such as webinar schedules. We also worked with students to create animations, and I'm glad to have consequentially picked up new skillsets like <b>SVG manipulation</b> and <b>CSS spritesheet animation</b> which were essential to bringing these elements to life!
